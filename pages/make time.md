title: make time
---

- considering an average adult spends >4 hours a day scrolling through their phone and another > 4 hours watching tv shows, distraction is really a full time job
- few of us have control over our schedule. But we do have control over our attention.
- What is a good reason to look at your phone at this very moment? Not an excuse, a reason.
- [[Block your calendar]]
	- Save some time for yourself as "energizing" time. Do not be greedy. Start from 1-2 hours a day. Label on your calendar as "do not schedule".
	- If people try to double book, just say "I have already got plans".
	- I need to learn to [[prioritize my own needs]]
- One way to fight FOMO (fear of missing out): look at intentionally choosing not to follow what everyone else is doing as a way to stand out, in a good way. When people see that you are carefully allocating your attention, they will notice. It shows them what is important to you. It inspires them to question their own default and step away from their own Infinity Pools. Basically you are setting a good example.
- Make a distraction-free phone
	- Delete all social apps?????
		- Maybe
	- Delete browser and mail???
		- I don't think I can
	- Delete other infinity pool apps
		- I can delete 小红书 but I will keep Youtube
