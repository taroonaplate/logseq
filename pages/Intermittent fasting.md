title: Intermittent fasting
---

## [[December 16th, 2020]] listened at work

## Also called intermittent energy restrition:
### either alternative fasting and fed days in a week, or fasting/ fed hours within a day

### <25% of requirements on the fasting days

## detection bias: the feeling that you noticed the outcome feels more often than it actually occurs because you are looking for it.

## 

## What is [[AMSTAR 2]] method? 

## 

## PICO in RCT/ systematic review = population, intervention, comparison, outcome

## 

## 3 studies found statistically insignificant differences in **weight loss** between control group to energy restricted groups

## 

## In forest plot, if the overall diamond crosses the null value, it means the result is statistically insignificant

## 

## Interestingly, there was sex differences in weight change: the results were statistically significant in men but not in women. SO UNFAIR LOLLL

## 

## Lean Body Mass: mixed findings. But the Roman study found higher lean body mass loss in the intermittent fasting group- also this finding was statistically significant.

## 

## Fat mass: Harris' review was the only one found statistically significant loss of  -1.38kg of fat. However, the time varied from 12 to 52 weeks for the study to be included in Harris- not very important over that long of a time frame.

## 

## On average: decreased quality of life.

## 

## IER: Higher chance of feeling cold, constipation, headaches and bad breath (on IER days); A lack of concentration, pre-occupation with food, mood swing.

### Looked at benefits on **anthropometric parameters** and **cardiometabolic risk factors**
#### WEAK evidence for paleolithic, intermittent energy restriction, Nordic, vegetarian, and portfolio dietary patterns

#### Strongest and most consistent evidence: Mediterranean diet
