- Reading [[how to take smart notes]]
	- Need to find a good note-taking system that can use as a second brain or a dump for my random ideas
- How about Roam Research?
	- [[ali abdaal]] made a good video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP3dA2GcAh8 starting from 6:18 he showcases his graph which is an impressive spider web!
	- another video by Thomas Frank https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxOffM_tVHI
	- need to cancel subscription by the end of December
- Before going home, Annamae invited me to stay for wine again and I politely declined
	- which led to my random thoughts on my way home: [[Is it possible for someone to get drunk from using too much alcohol based hand sanitizers?]]
