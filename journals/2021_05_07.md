## toxic alcohol syndrome:
## sudden infant death syndrome
## Risk associated with drug abuse in pregnancy
### premature rupture of the membrane: detached placenta --> assicia risk for the baby, increase risk of cerebral palsy etc  -> treatment is therapeutic cooling
### premature birth
### contractions before term
### diminished bloodflow to the baby (cocaine)
### methamphetamines: [[preeclampsia]], HTN, premature birth
## heroine: increase risk of stillborn, increased risk of postpartum haemorrhages
## asphyxiated/ asphyxia
## opioids: morphine, oxycodone,
## benchmark for a healthy baby in the third trimester: minimal 10 kicks a day, the stronger the better
## IUGR: disproportionally small
## nicotine: placenta vasoconstriction --> less O2 and nutrients -> IUGR
## CO: prevents oxygen from binding
## vaping also contain nicotine, hence also discouraged. Contains nicotine but not carbon monoxide. Some of the aroma added
## hyperemesis: due to hormonal imbalances
### main issue: hydration and nutrient providance to the infant
### the majority lasts only during the first trimester: when the CVS develops
### No1 prescription is antiemetic/antireflux (must be scheduled and cover 24 hour)
#### famotidine
### IV hydration, anti antiemetic if needed
### other than that, NPO before nausea settles (24 to 48 hours)
### No2 no stress, start with plain dry crackers, liquid often worsens the situation
