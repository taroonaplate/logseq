## toxic alcohol syndrome:
## sudden infant death syndrome
## Risk associated with drug abuse in pregnancy
### premature rupture of the membrane: detached placenta --> assicia risk for the baby, increase risk of cerebral palsy etc  -> treatment is therapeutic cooling
### premature birth
### contractions before term
### diminished bloodflow to the baby (cocaine)
### methamphetamines: [[preeclampsia]], HTN, premature birth
## heroine: increase risk of stillborn, increased risk of postpartum haemorrhages
## asphyxiated/ asphyxia
## opioids: morphine, oxycodone,
## benchmark for a healthy baby in the third trimester: minimal 10 kicks a day, the stronger the better
## IUGR: disproportionally small
## nicotine: placenta vasoconstriction --> less O2 and nutrients -> IUGR
## CO: prevents oxygen from binding
## vaping also contain nicotine, hence also discouraged. Contains nicotine but not carbon monoxide. Some of the aroma added
## hyperemesis: due to hormonal imbalances
### main issue: hydration and nutrient providance to the infant
### the majority lasts only during the first trimester: when the CVS develops
### No1 prescription is antiemetic/antireflux (must be scheduled and cover 24 hour)
#### famotidine, diclectin
### IV hydration, anti antiemetic if needed
### other than that, NPO before nausea settles (24 to 48 hours)
### No2 no stress, start with plain dry crackers, liquid often worsens the situation; banana, less stinky cheese, small frequent meals, if tolerated for 24 hours, add fluids in small sips, ginger ale usually tolerated well, water less so, no acidic juice such as OJ, if able to tolerate water, start changing meds to po, and space out meds (change to less frequently)-> takes a week
