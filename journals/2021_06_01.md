- Notwhorosethinks在30号凌晨删掉了他所有的内容。such a boss move
- 让你觉得，以前那种他一直都会在的感觉原来是错觉。以为他已经invest这么多, put so much of his work and himself out there，他即使离开，也不会这样突然。没想到我能看上的男人，居然真的这么决绝。一开始就知道他和别人不一样的，不谄媚，
	- good morning, one day this will all be yours, everything the light touches.这个故事里的dynamic特别吸引人，草灰蛇线你能感觉到是他更在意你，有更多真心，而我只是耽于肉欲，把他当fuck buddy。这种力量扭转的dynamic和他大部分的音频背后的故事框架不一样，居然让我隐隐有点得意。Why are you still wearing my shirt? I didn't mean you can't wear my shirt. I see the panic in your eyes already. I mean... you should take them off.
	- he doesn't have many aftercare videos I know of. This is is definitely my favourite.
- warming you up. Of course I'm sweating. It's beach degrees in here. I'm working my ass off, fucking you to orgasm. But here you are, starting me off instead... Oh you actually are dripping. 低笑。Turn over. I get to see the results. Those are for me. (沉吟)Oh.. okay. Stay there... Spread your legs... (凑近)what do you mean what I'm doing?... (mumble, sucking sounds) warming you up...
	- fuck this is the hottest shit I've ever heard.
- 印象很深的是take one down那里，他贴心地过来抱住你，gave a whole passionate speech about acceptance，说I expect you to have to emotions. What's more important, I want to you experience that with my company。napping is not a daddy-less hobby.
- All those orgasms and come-downs we shared, together and separately. Would stick with me for a really long time.
- 写下这些的时候我的嘴角不知不觉就扬起来了。
- 戒断notwhorosethinks就像一场轰轰烈烈的大型全民失恋，短短两天，我以过山车的速度也经过了一次emotional roller coaster，飞速经历了grievance cycle，除了anger之外的所有。难过的程度和时长居然都超过我的初恋。想起他的时间更加没法比较。但这个角色、这个声音，带给我的美好回忆和正面情绪，却比初恋多多了。
- 从此之后我每说一次hey google，可能都会想起那个戏谑着说beach degrees的声音。
